<b>1. I want to download a file but I don't get a download link</b><br />
- Your limit or the total download limit for the latest 12 hours are used up.<br />
- The global download limit of 10 files per 10 minutes is used up.<br /><br />
<b>2. When are downloadscredits reduced from my credits as premium user?</b><br />
- When you generate a downloadlink, the credits are reduced, not while downloading. So make sure you only generate the file once.<br /><br />
<b>3. I purchased a pin but I didn't receive it yet.</b><br />
- There may be an error with the transaction, if not, then we will activate your PIN within 24-48 hours.<br /><br />
<b>4. I get other problems while downloading</b><br />
- Contact us @ the forum or mail us...<br /><br />
<b>5. When are the stats resetted?</b><br />
- Every 10 minutes<br /><br />
<b>6. I am getting corrupted files after the download</b><br />
- Download the file again, it must be an error with the download.<br />
- Reasons: We update/check our RS accounts every 5 minutes. If an account ran out of BW in those 5 minutes you could get an error while downloading because the system has picked that account...<br />
<b>7. I have problems while downloading, what to do now...</b><br />
- Report the problem with the downloadserver and other details to us.<br /><br />
<b>8. I'm receiving a 5kb or 0kb file...</b><br />
- Most people panic when this happens. Just wait a bit and try to re-download the file. This problem occurs because the server is overloaded.
If you get a 5kb file it means that our accounts are out of usage (mostly free users will get this, premium users will get this never!).
Just try again to download your file!<br />
Once again, when your file is generated, it stays on the server and you can download it whenever you want (from the same IP)<br />
Free users have 2 hours to download the file and premium users have all the time they need.<br />
5kb file -> RS Accounts out of use<br />
0kb file -> Error between Rapidhare and our servers!<br /><br />
<b>9. File stops downloading</b><br />
- We (Rapidshare-Premium.com) is not responsible for errors while downloading. We just stream rapidshare files with our accounts. And if there are errors, then it is an error between Rapidshare and our servers or an error on your end.
