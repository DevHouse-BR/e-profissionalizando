RapidDownloader Premium has some good features<br /><br />
1) No shared bandwidth<br />
2) No time limits<br />
3) Your generated files will stay on the server forever. But only if your ip changes you won't be able to download them. That's to protect the generated files from leeching.<br />
4) History: Generated History means that when you have generated a file, you just can re-generate it after you have generated it on the main site. This allows users to download the files from anywhere they are! Because a generated file is connected to the IP from where the file has been generated. You won't loose any credits after you have re-generated one or more files. Re-Generated files won't show up in your generated files history.<br />
5) Referral Program: only for premium users with a valid pin which contains more then 1 credits. A maximum of 30 visits to the referral link will be credited into the account, but it will be resetted every day.<br />
6) Select your download server - There are 2 servers for shared bandwidth and 1 server for premium downloads so the speed on that server will be the best!<br />
